	/*
	 * ByteArrayOutputStream: An instance of this class contains an internal buffer
	 * to write a bytes stream. FilterOutputStream: An instance of this class
	 * contains some other output stream as a basic source of data for further
	 * manipulation. BufferedOutputStream: This enables a FilterOutputStream
	 * instance to make use of a buffer for output data. DataOutputStream: An
	 * instance of this class enables writing primitive Java types to an underlying
	 * output stream in a machine-independent manner. PrintStream: This empowers the
	 * OutputStream objects with the ability to print representations of various
	 * data values conveniently. FileOutputStream: An instance of this class is used
	 * to output a stream for writing data to a file or to a file descriptor.
	 * ObjectOutputStream: An instance of this class is used to serialize an object
	 * which can be deserialized with ObjectInputStream. PipedOutputStream: An
	 * instance of this class provides a pipe or buffer for output byte that works
	 * in the FIFO manner.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 2.Character Streams
	 * 
	 * Reader: Top-level abstract class to read to character streams.
	 * BufferedReader: Provides an in-between buffer for efficiency while reading
	 * text from character input stream. 
	 * LineNumberReader: Uses a buffered character input stream that keeps track of line numbers. CharArrayRead er: Implements an
	 * auto-increasing character buffer that may be used as a reader. FilterReader:
	 * An instance of this class is used for reading character files.
	 * 
	 * PushbackReader: This enables a character to be pushed back into the stream
	 * after reading. InputStreamReader: An instance of this class provides a bridge
	 * from byte streams to character streams. Bytes are decoded into characters
	 * using a specified character set. FileReader: An instance of this class is
	 * used for reading character files. PipedReader: Uses a pipe for character
	 * input stream. StringReader: Character output stream reader from source
	 * string. Writer: Top-level abstract class to write to character streams.
	 * BufferedWriter: Provides an in-between buffer for efficiency while writing
	 * text to a character output stream. CharArrayWriter: Implements an
	 * auto-increasing character buffer that may be used as a writer. FilterWriter:
	 * Abstract class for writing filtered character streams. OutputStreamWriter: An
	 * instance of this class provides a bridge between character streams and byte
	 * streams. Characters are encoded into bytes using a specified character set.
	 * 
	 * FileWriter: An instance of this class is used for writing character files.
	 * PipedWriter: Uses a pipe for character output stream.
	 * 
	 *  PrintWriter: Prints a formatted representation of an object to a test-output stream. StringWriter:
	 * Character output stream is collected in a string buffer and may be used for
	 * constructing a string.
